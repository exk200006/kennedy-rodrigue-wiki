MRI Safety Training - BPI
----
In case you need to go to the MRI scanner, it’s a good idea to attend MRI safety training at the BPI. The training is typically done in two parts, one online and one in-person. Each Angela (Angela.Plata@UTDallas.edu) to get set up in BioRaft. (BioRaft is the online platform that will tell you when MRI training is expiring and where you’ll complete the online portion).

Gaining Access to BPI MRI Scheduling System
----
Angela Plata is your contact for all things BPI! She should be able to add you to the calendar to schedule our participants. Once you’re in the Lab Resources system, you can start to schedule participants: 

Once you’re set up, go to the following address: https://labresources.utdallas.edu and log in using your UTD NetID and password

Hover over “Reservations” and select “Schedule.” This will take you to the calendar page. Click and drag the time and date you would like to schedule. This will then take you to another page to fill out participant information. You can schedule on either Scanner 2 or the Meadows scanner.

This is how you fill out the reservation for KR’s MCI Study: 

**If scheduling for KR’s MCI study:** 
The cost center is 21855041 and the Project/IRB Number is 19-126. Karen Rodrigue is the Primary Investigator. Description is: MCI XXXX, Participant set up (first 15 minutes) scan time (1 hour 15 minutes) (extra 15 minutes padding time) User-supplied external hard drive. 

Schedule the MRI scanner for 1 hour and 45 minutes. Then schedule either the Meeting and Consent room or the Conference Room for 30 minutes before the scan time.

**MRI Safety Training – AIRC**
Email Leticia Lopez (leticia.lopez@utsouthwestern.edu) stating you are needing to complete MRI Safety Training. 

**Gaining Access to AIRC MRI Scheduling System**
Email Jeannie Baxter (Jeannie.Baxter@UTSouthwestern.edu) and let her know you work in Dr. Kristen Kennedy’s lab and you need access to schedule MRIs. (The AIRC is used for KK’s longitudinal study.) Jeannie will be able to assist you in setting up access to iLab. Once you’ve created an account you can schedule participants: 

Click the green “login” button. You’ll then click “here” to login as a UTSW user

Make sure to schedule on the 3TB -Phillips Achieva 3T MR System. Here’s what the calendar will look like: 

To schedule, click and drag on the date and time you would like. You will be prompted to select a Lab and Select Kennedy, Kristen (UTD) lab. Not UTSW lab! Fill out the following information and click “Save Reservation”

To make a reservation for the Mock Scanner: schedule time for 1 hour.

**Getting UT Southwestern ID**
Email Shanagra Jones (shanagra.jones@utsouthwestern.edu) following info:
1.	CV
2.	Date of birth
3.	Home address
4.	Cell phone number
5.	Citizenship status (do you have a visa?)
6.	Social security number (you can call her to give this information, instead of emailing)
7.	Highest level of education achieved
8.	Marital status
9.	Gender
10.	Name of your project PI

*Also inquire about how to get badge access*

Once your UT Southwestern ID has been approved, Jean Matthews will email you with your username and temporary password. You’ll need to change your password from the temporary one to a permanent one and register an additional authentication method (this will be a link in the email Jean will send). I suggest your second authentication method be something you have easy access to, like your cell phone number rather than the lab number. 

Your UTSW password expires one year after you create it. (There are supposed to be reminder emails). If your password expires, you should go to the UTSW Web Outlook App and put in your old password. It should prompt you to change your password and will ask you to authenticate yourself. If this doesn’t work, email Jean Matthews and tell her that your password has expired and that you need to be re-approved for access. I called the UTSW help desk initially, but they said that they didn’t have enough information to authenticate me. Alternatively, you could avoid all of this by changing your password on a regular basis. 

Once you have your UTSW ID, request access to eIRB and Velos by filling out an eResearch Access Authorization request form. Once the form has been submitted, you should get an email letting you know you have access and will probably request you sign up to take an eIRB/Velos training class. 

Jean Matthews (jean.mathews@utsouthwestern.edu) is a good person to reach out to for questions, but Shanagra is the best contact to help get you started. 

**Getting Access to the studies in Velos and eIRB**

•	**To get access to the studies in Velos**, have one of the professors add you in the site/team tab of their studies. You should be added as a primary administrative contact. 
•	**To get access to the studies in eIRB**, a modification needs to be submitted to the IRB by either KK/KR or the current primary administrative contact. The modification should be a study personnel modification and should change whoever needs access to the eIRB to be the primary administrative contact. The current primary administrative contact should comment in the comment section about who is being added and that they need to be added as the study’s administrative contact.  

**How to log into eIRB and Velos**

Go to this web address https://www.utsouthwestern.edu. Velos will be used to schedule KR’s MCI Study PET participants and eIRB will be used to modify all studies. 

Click “MyUTSW” and log in with your UTSW credentials 

You should arrive to a homescreen that looks like this:

Select either "eIRB" or "Velos" to access

**How to Submit a Modification or Continuing Review**

This is what eIRB looks like. To submit a modification or continuing review, select a study and click “New Modification” or “New Continuing Review”

**How to Schedule a PET Session**

Log into Velos. You should get a home screen that looks like this:

Hover over "Manage" and click "Search"

If the participant comes up:

• Go to the "Protocols" tab and select "16772"

• Click “Add Multiple Status” and this will generate a pop up box. You’ll need the date the participant completed the phone screen, the date the participant signed the general study consent form, and the date the participant signed the PET consent form specifically. You’ll need to scroll down and enter the e-signature “1234” and click submit. 


•	Then open the Participant Scheduling Request Form and complete

o	Study-pams/Participant_Administrative/Tracking/PET/Scheduling Request Form/Blank Scheduling Request 

o	Fill out this form and email it to Ellie Phillip (Elizeva.Phillips@UTSouthwestern.edu) and RADTMIC@UTSouthwestern.edu. Ellie will email you back appointment times. 

If the participant show up on the initial search: 

•	Email Kelli Key (Kelli.Key@UTSouthwestern.edu) with the participant’s name, D.O.B., sex, address, and telephone number. She will enter them into Velos and let you know when it’s done. Then you can search for them and complete the previous steps. 

**Getting PET Credentialed**

*Ask Vincent Edwards how he just got PET credentialed!*

This is what the previous lab manager said: 
The Professors may ask you to be PET credentialed depending on the status of the PET study. If they do, you need to email Kathryn Kocurek (Kathryn.Kocurek@UTSouthwestern.edu) the following info: 

1.	CITI training:
