Continuing Review(CR)
----

Every year, the IRBs for each study are reviewed by UTSW and UTD IRBs. Each study has a specific
expiration date, and a continuing review needs to be completed and approved by that date.  It can take 
four or more weeks for the IRB to review your submitted review and they may request you make 
changes after they’ve reviewed your submission, so plan accordingly. Depending on what the study’s 
status is (e.g., actively collecting participants, actively analyzing data, etc.) the CR smartform will differ. 
The continuing review smartform is essentially all the questions that the eIRB prompts you to answer 
depending on what type of continuing review you are completing. I strongly recommend printing out 
the Continuing Review smartform from the previous year to help guide you in completing the CR for the
current year.

The most time consuming portions of the CR are:

Enrollment and Study Progress

- Participant counts by ethnic group

- You'll use the information from the study tracking file for this

Citations List

- List of poster presentations and papers that have been presented/published using the data
					 
- You'll want to ask lab members for their most recent poster and publication citations.

For the other sections, you can use the previous responses as a guide for how to answer the question 
for the current CR. The PI (principal investigator) is the only person who can submit a CR, so make sure 
you schedule a time with KK or KR to submit the CR once you’ve completed all the sections that you can. 
This meeting should be at least 30 days before the CR expires, but preferably sooner. You should also 
think about what’s going on in the lab around the time the CR is due, like conferences or winter break 
and schedule accordingly. If you have any questions about the CR, you can talk to David (he’s the only
person in the lab that’s worked on a CR before).

Once the IRB has reviewed the CR, they will either request changes or approve the CR. If they 
request changes, they’ll attach a letter to their request and you should follow their instructions. One 
thing to note - if the IRB reviewer requests multiple changes, those changes should all be done in one 
modification to the continuing review. **You cannot submit more than one modification on a continuing
review at one time, and the PI needs to submit any modification to the Continuing Review.** However, 
if the modification is mistakenly submitted without all the changes the requested, you can call the IRB 
reviewer and explain the situation and they will send the modification back to you electronically for the 
additional changes.  Once the IRB has reviewed the changes, they will either approve or request further 
changes.

If the IRB approves your continuing review, then you need to send the following documents to 
the UTD IRB for review:

- Consent Forms
- HIPPA forms
- Study Protocol
- Study CR Smartform
- Letter of Approval from UTSW

Log into Cayuse(UTD's IRB) https://utdallas.cayuse.com. Select the study and click "New Submission."
From the drop down select whichever is appropriate (modification or continuing review).
