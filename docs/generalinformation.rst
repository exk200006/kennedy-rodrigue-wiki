**General Advice**

I recommend taking some time to just explore the server. I found it to be the best way to learn about everything going on in the lab. There will be times when someone asks you if you know if some random thing exists on the server and the more familiar you are with it, the better you’ll be able to answer their questions. Also, ask the grad students to talk to you about their projects or the imaging modality that they’re primarily concerned with. It’s helpful to have an idea about what each of the modalities are and the types of research questions they’re used to answer. If you’re ever unsure about an administrative task, check with Shelbie Vines or Camila Cristiani. Generally, they tend to have all the answers and if they don’t, they can find the person who does. 

**General Information about Working in the Lab**
----
1.	When there’s a participant (any lab’s participant) waiting in the hallway or the lobby, check with the participant to see if they have been in contact with the person they’re here to see or if they need any help. If they need help, ask them if they received a confirmation and if they know the name of the person they’re here to see. If they do, then call the person using teams or call Ashley or Shelbie and they can get ahold of whose participant it is. They have access to study calendars for all the labs at CVL, and would be able to see if they’re scheduled for a particular lab.

  a.  For contact with our participants, I tell them to call our lab phone number when they arrive so they can call us directly and there’s less delay between their arrival and starting their appointment. ::

2.	Everyone in the lab uses slack to contact each, so you’ll want to make sure KK or KR add you to the slack channel! They have to do this as they are the admins.
